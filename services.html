			<p>If you are looking for someone to solely work on big animals, I might not be your person. But if you just need someone to check up on them, give their advice, and occasionally go out and visit them, then I am the person for you. I have spent a lot of my adult life working with regular house hold pets, but I have done my fair share of larger animals. Right now, I am in charge of a couple of horses that require meds and an occasional check up. I can't say I am an expert on big animals, but I surely know what I am doing.
